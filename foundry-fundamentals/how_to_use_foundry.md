Create a new folder with the project name.

Then run the following command:

If the directory is empty then use:
```
forge init
```

If the directory is not empty then use:
```
forge init --force .
```

Note: In order to use "forge init" in a repo that is already a git repo,
you must have a clean working tree first. 
So push any unsaved changes to GitHub first,
before trying to create a new Foundry project with the ```forge init``` command
