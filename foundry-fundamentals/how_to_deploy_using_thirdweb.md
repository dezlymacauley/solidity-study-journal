Note: You will need to have nodejs, and npm installed first to use the npx command

Then run the following command in the root of your project:
```
npx thirdweb deploy
```

This will automatically detect the project type and compile the contract.

You will be prompted to select what contract you want to deploy.

After you have selected your contract, the contract metadata will be uploaded,
to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
