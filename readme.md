### Environment Setup (Arch Linux)


First make sure that you have the build tools installed:

`sudo pacman -S gcc`

`sudo pacman -S clang`


Next install the Solidity Compiler and the language server as well:
NOTE: On Arch Linux the only way to do this is via the AUR.

You will need an AUR helper like paru:
https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru

After installing paru, you can use it to install the solidity Compiler:
`paru -S solidity-bin`

`paru -S solidity-language-server`

To confirm that you now have the compiler, run the following command.
`solc --version`
